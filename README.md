Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to the programming puzzles provided by Advent of Code.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place throughout December. Each day, a new set of programming puzzles is released, covering various algorithms and data structures. It's a fantastic opportunity for programmers to sharpen their skills and have fun during the holiday season.

## Solutions Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for the years I participated. Each day's solution, of the ones I solved, is organized in its dedicated folder.
